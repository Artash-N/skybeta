# Hardware checklist

Physical checks, each paired with **the failure it prevents**. That pairing is the point:
every item on this list exists because skipping it once produced a symptom that looked
like a software bug and consumed real debugging time.

Two passes:

- **Build-time** — once per airframe, during assembly. §1–§4.
- **Pre-flight** — every single flight, no exceptions. §5.

## 1. TELEM2 ↔ Jetson serial link

### 1.1 The connector — read this before anything else

> **The single most expensive item on this list.** A damaged or partly-seated TELEM2
> JST-GH connector produces *intermittent* silence: hours of nothing, then one flawless
> run, then nothing again. It is indistinguishable from a configuration fault, and it
> cost an entire debugging session on the reference airframe before the cable was
> identified.

The Pixhawk 6C's TELEM2 port is a **JST-GH 1.25 mm 6-pin**. The pins are small, the
latch is small, and a housing that has been levered out sideways once will make
contact when you push on it and lose contact when you let go.

**Check:**

- [ ] Housing clicks home and the latch engages. Tug the cable gently along its axis —
      it must not move.
- [ ] All six crimps visible in the housing, none backed out.
- [ ] No cracked housing, no splayed latch, no bent pins on the board header.
- [ ] Cable is strain-relieved to the frame so vibration and prop wash do not work it
      loose in flight.

**Prevents:** intermittent or total loss of the EV datalink. On the ground it looks like
a parameter problem; in flight, if the link drops while `EKF2_EV_CTRL` is fusing vision,
EKF2 loses position aiding and the estimator degrades — which presents as exactly the
drift you would otherwise blame on `pose_frame` or `EKF2_EV_DELAY`.

**The debugging rule that follows from this.** Any *negative* UART result recorded with a
suspect cable in place is uninformative — it tells you nothing about configuration.
Positive results are still valid. Replace the cable, then re-run everything that
previously "failed". **Never bodge it with tape or glue on a flight vehicle.**

### 1.2 Wiring

Three wires. **VCC is not one of them.**

| Pixhawk 6C TELEM2 (JST-GH 6-pin) | → | Jetson 40-pin header | Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| pin 1 — **VCC (+5 V)** | ✗ | **not connected** | see below |
| pin 2 — **TX** | → | **pin 10** (`UART1_RX`) | FC transmits, Jetson receives |
| pin 3 — **RX** | ← | **pin 8** (`UART1_TX`) | Jetson transmits, FC receives |
| pin 4 — CTS | ✗ | not connected | no flow control |
| pin 5 — RTS | ✗ | not connected | no flow control |
| pin 6 — **GND** | → | **pin 6** (GND) | common reference |

- [ ] TX→RX and RX→TX, i.e. **crossed**. Straight-through is the classic mistake and
      gives perfect silence with no error anywhere.
- [ ] GND connected. Without it you get framing errors and garbage rather than silence.
- [ ] **VCC left unconnected.** Both boards are separately powered; joining the 5 V rails
      back-feeds one from the other. `MAV_1_FLOW_CTRL = 0` in
      [`../px4/params/01_telem2_mavlink.params`](../px4/params/01_telem2_mavlink.params)
      matches the unwired CTS/RTS.

Jetson pins 8/10 are `serial@3100000` → `/dev/ttyTHS1`.

**Verify (Jetson side alone, before the FC is even involved):**

```bash
# Jumper pin 8 to pin 10, nothing else connected:
python3 host/uart_loopback_test.py
```

Loopback passing means the Jetson's TX/RX path and the DMA/IOMMU device-tree patch are
good, so any remaining silence is on the cable or the FC. Loopback failing means stop —
nothing about the flight controller matters yet.

**Verify (end to end, after §1.1 and the FC has `01_telem2_mavlink.params` loaded):**

```bash
mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyTHS1,57600 --show-errors
```

Expected: a HEARTBEAT within a second or two. 57600 rather than 921600 deliberately —
more tolerant of marginal wiring while you are still chasing a dead link.

**Prevents:** every UART symptom in this repo's history.

## 2. OAK-D-S2

### 2.1 It must be on the USB **3.0** hub

- [ ] Plugged into a **USB 3.0** port (blue, or the USB3 hub on `bus 2`), with a
      USB 3-rated cable. A USB 2 cable in a USB 3 port negotiates USB 2.

**Verify — and do not be fooled by `lsusb` before the camera boots:**

The MyriadX enumerates **twice**.

| Stage | ID | Speed | Bus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unbooted (power-on, no firmware) | `03e7:2485` | **480 Mbps** | bus 1 |
| Booted (depthai has pushed firmware) | `03e7:f63b` | **5000 Mbps** | `2-1.1` (bus 2) |

Seeing `03e7:2485` at 480 Mbps is **normal and expected** on a healthy USB 3.0 link. It
is not evidence of anything. `host/doctor.sh` reports it as a pass for this reason.

To actually measure the link, boot the device:

```bash
host/doctor.sh --boot-camera
# or, in the container:
python3 -c "
import depthai as dai
with dai.Device() as d: print(d.getUsbSpeed())"     # expect UsbSpeed.SUPER
```

**Prevents:** hours of bandwidth reasoning built on the pre-boot reading. Every
throughput conclusion drawn from the 480 Mbps figure is wrong.

Related, and worth knowing so you do not chase it: the frame-rate ceiling on this camera
is **not** USB. The MyriadX's XLink transport tops out near 120–140 MB/s regardless of
link rate, which is why the stack runs **1024×640 @ 30 Hz** and not the sensor's native
1280×800 (which measures 23.3 Hz with mismatched left/right frames). See
[`debugging.md`](debugging.md) §3.

### 2.2 Camera identity

Read it off the device rather than trusting the label:

```bash
host/run.sh shell        # then, inside:
python3 -c "
import depthai as dai
with dai.Device() as d:
    for f in d.getConnectedCameraFeatures(): print(f)"
```

Expected on an OAK-D-S2: `CAM_A = IMX378` 4056×3040 colour; `CAM_B`/`CAM_C` = **`OV9282`
1280×800 monochrome**; IMU **BNO086** (units built Q2 2021–Q2 2023 carry a 6-axis BMI270
instead, which changes what IMU fusion can do).

- [ ] Stereo pair reports `OV9282`, not OV9782.
- [ ] IMU part recorded in the fleet table.

**Prevents:** IMU-fusion plans that assume a 9-axis part on a drone that has a 6-axis one.

### 2.3 Mounting and the mount pose

- [ ] Camera rigidly mounted — no foam, no zip-tie flex. A stereo rig that moves relative
      to itself invalidates the baseline cuVSLAM reads from TF.
- [ ] Lenses clean, no protective film left on.
- [ ] Field of view clear of props, legs and the battery. Rotor blur in frame is a
      texture source that moves with the vehicle.
- [ ] Cable routed so it cannot foul a prop, with a service loop at the camera end.

**Measure the mount pose and write it down.** Translation from the **Pixhawk's primary
IMU** (that is where PX4 puts the body origin — not the CoG, not the frame centre, not
the GPS antenna) to the **left** stereo lens focal point, in FLU body axes: +x forward
along the Pixhawk's mounting arrow, +y left, +z up. Then the rotation of the camera in
that same frame.

```bash
#              x     y     z    roll pitch  yaw      metres, then radians
host/run.sh stack 0.10  0.00 -0.02   0.0  0.35  0.0
```

- [ ] Translation measured, to ~5 mm.
- [ ] **Rotation measured.** A down-pitched VIO camera is the norm, and 0.35 rad ≈ 20°
      down is a typical value. Leaving it at zero when the camera is tilted is a real
      error, not a rounding one.
- [ ] `EKF2_EV_POS_X/Y/Z` on the flight controller are **all zero**.

**Prevents:** two distinct failures. An unmodelled mount *rotation* couples vehicle
rotation into apparent translation, which orbits — this is toilet-bowl suspect #4. And
setting `EKF2_EV_POS_*` while the static TF also carries the lever arm applies the offset
**twice**; pick exactly one, and this stack has picked the TF.

---

## 3. Jetson

- [ ] Powered from a supply that holds up under load. An Orin Nano browning out mid-flight
      takes the whole navigation stack with it.
- [ ] Adequate airflow over the heatsink. Thermal throttling shows up as frame-rate
      instability that looks like a camera problem.
- [ ] microSD / NVMe has room for bags. `record_bag.sh` writes both camera streams.
- [ ] `host/doctor.sh` exits 0.

`doctor.sh` covers, without needing sudo: L4T release · UARTA `iommus`/`dmas` in the live
device tree · `3100000.serial` bound to `serial-tegra` owning `ttyTHS1` · exactly one
`FDT` line in `extlinux.conf` · `dialout` + `docker` membership · docker `nvidia` runtime
· OAK-D enumerated · UART traffic · image present · power model.

Two results that are expected on a bench unit and are **not** faults: `uart-traffic` FAILs
when the FC is unpowered or the cable is the suspect one (§1.1), and `oakd-usb` reporting
`03e7:2485` at 480 Mbps is the unbooted stage (§2.1).

## 4. RC and the safety pilot's controls

There is **always a safety pilot on RC**. The flight interface has no arm path and never
changes mode; the pilot arms, the pilot selects Offboard, and the pilot can take the
vehicle back at any instant. Nothing in the software substitutes for these checks.

- [ ] Receiver **bound** to this vehicle's transmitter, and the transmitter's model
      memory is the right one. Ten identical airframes make this an easy mistake.
- [ ] Radio calibration done **on this airframe** (QGC → Radio). It is per
      transmitter+receiver pair and is deliberately excluded from
      [`00_baseline.params`](../px4/params/00_baseline.params).
- [ ] Mode switch assigned, and the pilot knows which position is Offboard.
      `RC_MAP_FLTMODE` on the reference airframe is channel 6.
- [ ] **Kill switch assigned and physically tested** — motors off, then arm, confirm the
      switch disarms, then disarm. `RC_MAP_KILL_SW` on the reference airframe is
      channel 7. Test it before every session, not once at build time.
- [ ] Failsafe behaviour understood: `COM_RCL_EXCEPT`, `COM_OF_LOSS_T`, `COM_OBL_RC_ACT`.
      Know what the vehicle does when your node stops publishing, before it does.
- [ ] Range check at the flying site.

**Prevents:** the class of failure where the only remaining option is to wait and watch.

---

## 5. Pre-flight — every flight

Ordered so a failure stops you before the props spin.

1. [ ] **Props off** for the first run of any new code. Bench it.
2. [ ] TELEM2 connector reseated and tugged (§1.1). Thirty seconds. It is the cheapest
       item here and the one that has actually bitten.
3. [ ] OAK-D lenses clean, view unobstructed, cable clear of the props.
4. [ ] Battery charged, secured, and the correct pack for the tuned parameters.
5. [ ] `host/doctor.sh` → exits 0.
6. [ ] `host/run.sh stack` up; on a ground-station shell:
       - [ ] `/skybeta/state` shows `px4_link: true`
       - [ ] `/visual_slam/tracking/odometry` publishing, and `odom_enu` moves sensibly
             when you carry the vehicle
       - [ ] your node is publishing `/skybeta/setpoint/pose` **before** the pilot
             touches the mode switch
7. [ ] `record_bag.sh` (or `host/run.sh bag`) started. Record every flight — it is the
       only way to explain a bad one afterwards, and it costs nothing on a good one.
8. [ ] Kill switch tested this session (§4).
9. [ ] Safety pilot has the transmitter, is standing clear, and has said so out loud.
10. [ ] Pilot arms, takes off manually, establishes a stable hover at ~1.5 m, **then**
        flips to Offboard.
